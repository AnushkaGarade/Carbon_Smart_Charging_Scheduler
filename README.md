# ⚡ Carbon‑Smart EV Charging Scheduler

A **machine‑learning driven decision support system** that intelligently schedules Electric Vehicle (EV) charging by **balancing user urgency and carbon intensity of the power grid**. The project integrates **unsupervised learning, time‑series forecasting, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard**, backed by a production‑ready FastAPI service.

---

## 🚀 Project Motivation

With the rapid adoption of Electric Vehicles, **uncoordinated charging** can:

* Overload local power grids
* Increase peak‑hour emissions
* Waste opportunities to charge during cleaner energy windows

This project addresses the problem by:

* **Classifying EV users** based on urgency and energy needs
* **Predicting carbon intensity** for a given future timestamp
* **Advising carbon‑smart charging decisions** without compromising user requirements

## 🧩 Key Features

### 🔹 Intelligent User Classification

* Uses **K‑Means clustering** to group users based on:

  * Arrival hour
  * Charging duration
  * Energy requirement
* Clusters are **mapped to meaningful labels**:

  * **Urgent User** (needs immediate charging)
  * **Flexible User** (can delay charging)

### 🔹 Carbon Intensity Forecasting

* Predicts grid carbon intensity for a **future timestamp**
* Automatically extracts temporal features:

  * Hour of day
  * Day of week
  * Month
* Supports **future‑aware prediction** (no data leakage)

### 🔹 Clean & Intuitive UI

* Built using **Streamlit** with custom CSS
* Visually distinguishes urgent vs flexible users
* Provides actionable feedback:

  * Low‑carbon window detected
  * Recommendation to delay charging

### 🔹 Production‑Ready Backend

* FastAPI with modular endpoints
* Hosted on **Render**
* Models loaded safely with environment‑agnostic paths
